# Landmarks

## Project Overview
For this project, I used a swift file from [Apple Inc](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/handling-user-input). I was playing around with the JSON file, and my group partner and I realized that we could twist it and create our own version of the application in Swift. We decided we went to add our favorite places from the Middle East.


## How I complete the completed the project? 
1. The first was to finding what locations we wanted to put in the application.
2. Once we found enough to replace the current locations, we started to switch out the longituide and latitude coordinates in the JSON file.
3. Afterwards, we changed the names of the location as well as the descriptions for each location. We alos listed different activity that you could do in said location. This was also done in JSON. 
4. Once we were done with the JSON, my group partner was able to change the photo to each landmark (which is in "Assets").
5. Lastly, we decided to change the background color to colors from each others flag. So, since we put landmarks from Egypt and Lebanon, we decided to make the colors red, white, and green in "LandmarkDetail". And we also changed the button color in "FavoriteButton" and we had to fix the dimensions of the images size in "CircleImage".
